      <pre>[Intro]
          Wheezy Beats
          
          [Chorus]
          No, I will not answer
          Please do not, don't call my phone
          Mr. Do-Not-Answer-Phone
          Please don't girl, no, leave me 'lone
          Double cup, it's styrofoam
          Pull up, my car, it go vroom
          This a coupe, no-no legroom
          Pull up on your bitch like zoom
          
          [Post-Chorus]
          What, you thought that I wasn't gon' come through?
          What you thought, I wasn't gon' get comfortable?
          You know I wouldn't do this if it wasn't you
          
          [Bridge]
          Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
          Yeah, yeah-yeah
          I know what I can and what I can't do
          
          [Pre-Chorus]
          I know every time that I'ma come through
          Yeah, I just turned to the big man
          Big shoes, big hands, counting big bands
          Big B on the back of my new pants
          She saw the zippers and said, "Those are some sick pants"
          Ooh, I cop Balmain by the flurry
          I got all this money nowadays so I can't worry
          Breathe in, breathe out, so a bitch can't serve me
          Size 29 my jeans but my clip is a 30
          
          [Chorus]
          No, I will not answer
          Please do not, don't call my phone
          Mr. Do-Not-Answer-Phone
          Please don't girl, no, leave me 'lone

          What you thought, I wasn't gon' get comfortable?
          You know I wouldn't do this if it wasn't you
          
          [Bridge 2]
          Ooh, I'ma get it, run it up, have no choice
          I'm a sing 'til I got no voice
          I don't fuck with you boys
          
          [Pre-Chorus]
          I know every time that I'ma come through
          Yeah, I just turned to the big man
